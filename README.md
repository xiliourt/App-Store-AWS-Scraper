## Apple App Store Price Scraper - Lambda Edition
- A free Lambda plan is likely enough for personal use.
  - I recommend using an AWS account without billing / with a limited card just incase 
- I recommend NOT setting a Lamba URL in environment variables unless you have authentication on the page

## Deployment
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fxiliourt%2FApp-Store-AWS-Scraper)

Once deployed with Vercel, follow instructions to deploy the Lambda Function and enter the URL.

- Requires an AWS account (free tier works)
- Requires a Vercel account (hobby (free) plan works)
